        <h1>About My Journey</h1>
          <p>
          My journey through Japan started not in the bustling capital of Tokyo, but in the soulful city of Osaka, a place that surprised me in the most wonderful ways. From the first step, I felt immersed in a culture where modern life and deep-rooted traditions coexist in harmony.
          This blog is more than a travel diary; it’s a personal reflection of the unforgettable moments I lived in Japan. It’s about the neon lights and ancient shrines, about bustling market streets and quiet temples nestled in the hills. In this series, I’ll share how each city revealed a unique piece of Japan’s soul.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">Through each bite, I discovered pieces of Japan, from cozy ramen bars in hidden alleys to sizzling okonomiyaki on quiet Kyoto streets.
    Every meal told a story: warm, personal, and rich in tradition.
    Tasting Japan wasn’t just about food, it was a journey of culture, comfort, and unforgettable moments.</p>

        <h1>Architecture</h1>
        <p>Japanese architecture beautifully blends tradition and modernity. Historic structures like Buddhist temples and wooden houses (minka) reflect values of simplicity, harmony with nature, and efficient use of space. Features such as sliding doors (shoji), tatami floors, and inner gardens highlight a deep appreciation for natural light and the use of emptiness as a design element.
        In contrast, Japan’s modern architecture is bold and innovative. Contemporary architects like Tadao Ando and Kengo Kuma skillfully combine concrete, wood, and glass to create spaces that are minimalist, sustainable, and deeply connected to their surroundings. The balance between traditional aesthetics and cutting-edge design is what makes Japanese architecture so unique and inspiring.</p>

  <section class="culture-section" id="culture">
    <div class="culture-content">
        <h1>Culture</h1>
        <p>Bonsai, tea ceremony, and calligraphy are more than just arts; they are profound expressions of Japanese culture and philosophy. Rooted in centuries of tradition, these practices emphasize harmony, mindfulness, and respect, core values in Japanese society. Bonsai reflects the connection to nature and patience required to nurture life in miniature form, symbolizing balance and impermanence. The tea ceremony is a spiritual ritual that fosters calmness, etiquette, and appreciation for simplicity, reinforcing social bonds and mindfulness in everyday life. Calligraphy combines artistic expression with discipline, capturing beauty and meaning in each brushstroke. Together, they embody the Japanese ideals of wabi-sabi (finding beauty in imperfection and transience) and zen principles, weaving art, spirituality, and daily living into a harmonious cultural tapestry that continues to influence modern Japan.</p>
